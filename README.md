## Stakeholders

**Stakeholder: Jahleel Townsend**
We interviewed Jahleel Townsend, a senior studying Computer Science at NYU, since he is representative of our target users.

### Goals: 
- Get help with daily tasks during the semester, especially during exams or other busy periods. 
- Save money and time.
- Connect with new people within the NYU community.

### Needs: 
- Cheap prices to meet student budget. 
- NYU student help rather than larger NYC community.

### Frustrations: 
- Current services (Doordash, Taskrabbit, etc.) are too expensive.
- There are no existing ways to reach out to random NYU students for help on tasks.

### Problems: 
- Security Concern: better to allow an NYU student into my home rather than a random person.

## Product Vision Statement

Our mobile app enhances student life by offering a platform where students can conveniently find and hire peers for various tasks.
